    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>
      I started my creative journey back in 2016 — when I first opened Photoshop  
      while studying IT at the Islamic University. What began as curiosity,  
      soon became a mission to visualize stories that connect and inspire.
      <br><br>
      In 2018, I shifted my academic path to Multimedia at UCAS — diving deep into design, motion graphics, and Blender.
      <br><br>
      Today, I am an <strong>Art Director & Motion Designer</strong> with a passion for building brands,  
      leading visual teams, and creating visuals that leave an impact.
