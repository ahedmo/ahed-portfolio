    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>I was born in Gaza in 1998, and my passion for art and design started at a young age, sketching handmade illustrations before discovering the beauty of the digital world.</p>
    <h3>Learning Journey</h3>
    <p>I began by creating static designs and brand logos, then moved on to editing with Adobe Premiere, explored motion and effects in After Effects, and today I'm honing my skills in 3D modeling and animation with Blender.</p>
    <h3>Professional Path</h3>
    <p>I launched my career on the Motion X platform, worked as a freelancer on Upwork and similar sites, founded my own creative team, and later joined Dot Motion as an Art Director, leading talented teams to achieve outstanding results.</p>
    <p>Despite limited resources and the ongoing conflict in Gaza, I continuously develop my 3D expertise and elevate the quality of my work through determination and creativity.</p>
    <p><strong>I am Ahed Mounis.</strong></p>
